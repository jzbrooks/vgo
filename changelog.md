## [Unreleased]

### New
- Use Android Studio conversion tools are used for SVG → vector drawable conversions

### Improvement

### Fix

### Upgrade

## 2.1.0

_09-14-2021_

- New: Simplified optimization machinery with `ElementVisitor`
- Improvement: `MergePaths` no longer requires its own tree traversal
- Improvement: Attribute values omit leading zeros where possible
- Fix: theme referenced colors like `?attrs/dark` no longer cause crashes
- Upgrade: Build tools

## 2.0.2

_06.02.2021_

- Fixed: Vector Drawable shorthand hex colors (like #FFF) are properly handled

## 2.0.1

_06.01.2021_

- Fixed: Groups that wrap clip paths are no longer removed

## 2.0.0

_05.29.2021_

- New, breaking(vgo-core): Structured graphic element attributes. 
  * This greatly simplifies the conversions between formats
  * Unstructured attributes will be dropped during conversion between formats
- Improvement, breaking(vgo): Unified the clip path implementation
- Improvement, breaking(vgo): Format-specific implementations of optimizations have been traded for format independent implementations, so they can be more easily used by new formats
- Improvement: The new implementation of the bake transformations optimization operates in many more situations for svg compared to the previous implementation
- Improvement: Remove redundant commands in situations where the command is effectively but not precisely redundant
- Fixed: Redundant move commands are removed
- Fixed: Test failures on Windows due to path handling
- Upgrade: Build with Kotlin 1.5.10

## 1.4.1

_02.16.2021_

- Added: A new type for the `shrinkVectorArtwork` task

## 1.4.0

_02.15.2021_

- Added: Gradle plugin
- Improved: Reworked the gradle modules to better be published as a library (vgo-core) and thin application wrapper (vgo).
- Added: Sonatype publishing

## 1.3.0

_01.18.2021_

- Added: Collapse multiple Bézier curves into elliptical arcs when possible
- Improvement: Target JVM 11

## 1.2.2

_10.20.2020_

- Improvement: Show filenames with statistics with multiple file inputs and `--stats`
- Improvement: Remove Kotlin metadata from the output jar
- Fixed: Temporarily removed an optimization that distorted some images

## 1.2.1

_10.01.2020_

- Fixed: Some images with curves that lie on a circle omit any representation of that circle in the output
- Fixed: Modifying files in-place sometimes results in destroying non-vector files.

## 1.2.0

_09.28.2020_

- Improvement: Resort to distribution via a fat jar. Requires managing fewer files and results in a smaller installation since R8 can operate on classes from dependencies as well.
- Improvement: Use R8 for optimization. R8 produces a slightly smaller jar and in some cases faster code as well.

## 1.1.1

_07.13.2020_

- Fixed: A crash when running on a file in the current directory
- Improvement: Report an error when an input file doesn't exist

## 1.1.0

_06.20.2020_

- New: Remove redundant close path commands
- Improvement: Use the Gradle Application Plugin to build application distrobutions, simplifying installation and making running the tool a little simpler.
